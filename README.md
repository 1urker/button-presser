# Button presser
Essentially works like an autoclicker, except with reconfigurable trigger and target keys/buttons.

# How to use
LShift + RShift = Rebind target key <br />
LCtrl + RCtrl = Rebind trigger key <br />
Shift + F6 = Kill program

# Bugs
•sometimes does not detect tigger key release <br />
•sometimes disables interactions with unfocused windows
