# button-presser
Presses buttons, but like, really fast

# What it does
Essentially works like an autoclicker, except with reconfigurable trigger and target keys/buttons.

# How to use
LShift + RShift = Rebind target key
LCtrl + RCtrl = Rebind trigger key
Shift + F6 = Kill program

# Bugs
•sometimes does not detect tigger key release
•sometimes disables interactions with unfocused windows
